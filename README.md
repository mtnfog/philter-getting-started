# Getting Started with Philter

This repository provides guides for getting started with [Philter](https://www.mtnfog.com/products/philter/), an application to identify and manipulate sensitive information, such as PHI and PII, in natural language text.

The [Getting Started with Philter](Getting Started with Philter.ipynb) notebook in this repository will walk you through creating an instance of Philter in your cloud and filtering sensitive information from some sample text.
